                    <p>Welcome to my tech journey! As a web3 developer, I've transformed from a coding novice to an enthusiastic participant in this exciting space. My journey began last year as a content writer in web3, but I soon felt the urge to explore the technology itself.</p>
    
                    <p>As the web3 content landscape became saturated, I found the <a href="https://learnable.genesystechhub.com/">Learnable Genesys program</a>, which offered a web3 development course. I was initially hesitant about coding, but the curriculum sparked my curiosity. I reminded myself that if others could succeed, so could I.</p>
    
                    <p>In January 2025, I enrolled in the 6-month internship program, officially starting my tech journey. I've explored various resources like freeCodeCamp and YouTube, learning everything from smart contracts to decentralized applications (DApps), even winning a Superteam Dev bounty!</p>
    
                    <p>Reflecting on my journey, I’m grateful for that bold step. I’m committed to ongoing growth, focusing daily on improving my skills through courses, internships, and projects. My goal is to excel in the industry, and I won't look back until I do.</p>
    
                    <p>Thank you for joining me! I'm excited to see where this path leads and to connect with fellow web3 enthusiasts.</p>
